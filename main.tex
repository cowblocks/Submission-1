\section{Introduction}

    This study will analyze a conceptually combined gas and steam turbine power plant and seek to maximize efficiency. The gas and steam turbine mechanisms will be modeled using ideal Brayton and Rankine thermodynamic cycles with component efficiency factored into the processes. The Brayton cycle models the gas turbine part of the power plant. In the Brayton cycle atmospheric air is first pumped into a combustion chamber raising the pressure of the gas. Combustion is then modeled as heat entering the system in an isobaric process, the temperature rises, but the pressure is constant. The now pressurized and heated gas is put through a turbine to generate work. However, the gas is still extremely hot and more work can be extracted from that energy. The hot gas is then put through a heat exchanger which inputs heat into the Rankine cycle. The Rankine cycle models a steam turbine, which uses the spent heat from the Brayton cycle to heat water into steam that drives a turbine providing more work out. Figure 1 diagrams the inputs/outputs and flow of the two cycles.

The requested design parameters of the power plant and the efficiency of the components are as follows:

In order to increase the efficiency of the entire powerplant both cycles should have their output maximised. The Brayton cycle's efficiency ultimately depends on the pressure ratio. However, as the temperature and pressure increase the costs and feasibility of building a compressor that can handle the high pressure and temperatures rises exponentially the efficiency gain levels off, compressing gas concentrates the heat energy, and compressing at a high temperature takes significantly more energy than a low-temperature gas. Eventually, the work required to compress the atmospheric air overcomes the work generated by the turbine.
A second compressor and inter-cooler can be installed to reduce the work required to compress the gas and the temperature limits of the compressor. Before compressing the gas to its final pressure, the gas is run through a heat exchanger in a constant pressure process. The excess heat can be used in other processes, and not as much work will be required to get the gas to the required pressure.
The Rankine cycle also has to deal with realistic pressure and temperatures requirement determined by our current material science. So increasing temperature and pressure to overcome other losses is not a realistic way to maximize efficiency. The cycle also has to deal with using a two-phase liquid gas mixture throughout the process. A pump can only deal with non-saturated water, and the turbine can only deal with steam at a higher than 90\% quality. So to maximize efficiency one would have to edge their way around the vapor dome, keeping the temperature from getting too high, keeping the compressor from having to over-compress the liquid, and the turbine quality above 90\%.
In order to edge along the vapor dome for the Rankine cycle a reheat cycle and a second turbine can be added. This way temperature doesn't have to get too high and a lower initial temperature can be used. The higher the difference in low and high temperatures will increase the amount of work that can be extracted from the steam. Excess heat energy from other parts of the powerplant, like the combustion chamber, that would have been lost to the atmosphere can be used in this reheat step. This would increase the work generation per unit of energy. This energy comes from burning expensive and polluting gas. 
This report will determine the increase in efficiency from using these extra components. From the results, the efficacy of installing them can be extrapolated from projected fuel savings against the projected cost.

\section{Modeling}

The attached Python script uses a database with experimental values for water and air at incremental states. Using the design requirements of the power plant for all the states of the working fluid/gas can be found. //I don't really know how technical you want us to get here, IE includes the formulae for finding work using h and such, and then using efficiency to find actual work, then using that to find the total efficiency. < ill probably include it to pad the word count anyway in the final report
Then the script iterates over the gas turbine pressure ratio in increments of 0.01 finding the resultant total work out. The pressure ratio is the maximum pressure divided by the minimal pressure. 

// Explain how I iterate over the graph, the boiler processes are constant Pressure and the turbine is constant S (Ideally).

// Explain how I iterate over different exit pressure of turbine 1 and various pressures for the Rankine cycle max and min, testing all for maximum efficiency.

Include minimum calculated quality and efficiency of Rankine with and without the reheat cycle. I need to edit the graph to include labels with states.
